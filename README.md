👽 Alien Survival

Alien Survival is a text-based survival game written in C++. The player must survive waves of alien attacks by managing health and resources while making tactical decisions through console-based input. The game showcases basic game loop logic, turn-based interactions, and structured programming.

🕹️ Gameplay Overview
The player must survive alien waves by choosing actions like attacking, healing, or using special resources. The game ends if the player's health drops to zero or all aliens are defeated.

✨ Features

- Console-based gameplay
- Turn-based combat system
- Simple health, damage, and survival logic
- Clear win/lose state management
- Modular C++ codebase

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- Interface: Console / Terminal
- Platform: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

📦 Prerequisites

- A working C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
- Optional: Code::Blocks or Visual Studio for easier build/run on Windows

🚀 Getting Started (🪟 Windows)
You can build and run the project on Windows using either Code::Blocks or Visual Studio:

✅ Option 1: Using Code::Blocks
Open Code::Blocks.

Create a new Console Application (C++).

Add all .cpp and .h files to the project:
main.cpp
Alien.cpp, Alien.h
Player.cpp, Player.h
Game.cpp, Game.h

Build and run (F9 or the green play button).

✅ Option 2: Using Visual Studio
Open Visual Studio.

Create a new Empty Project (C++).

Add all source and header files to the project.

Right-click the project > Set as Startup Project.

Build and run (Ctrl + F5).

🛠 Requirements
C++17 support (ensure your compiler is set to use C++17 or later)

No additional libraries required — the game is purely console-based.
